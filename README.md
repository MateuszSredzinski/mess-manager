# Mess Manager

An application that helps organize all the things you might have at home. Now, using this application, you can add items that you are always looking for. Can’t remember where you put the spare keys to your car or its service book? Can’t remember where you put the batteries for the remote control? There are as many examples as there are users.
Use cases: Family members use this application and have more time for themselves because they don’t have to search for things.

Development: The application is constantly being developed and currently runs on the local resources of the phone.

The plans include:

*cloud synchronization
*creating backups
*improved system for adding items
*specifying items quantities and deficits.

Done:
